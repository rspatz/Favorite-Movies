    <h3>James Bond: The World is not Enough</h3>
    <p>I love the opening boat chase scene, as well as the glamor and glitz.</p>

    <h3>James Bond: Die Another Day</h3>
    <p>
      This film features one of my favorite automobiles, the Jaguar,
      unfortunately, not the F-Type.

    <h3>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</h3>
    <p>
      I love the humor of this film, even in characters not normally known for
      their humor.

    <h3>American in Paris</h3>
    <p>Beautiful film with beautiful music. A masterpiece of cinema!</p>

    <h3>I Robot</h3>
    <p>
      This film seems appropriate at this time, with the rise of A.I. and
      robotics, and many people's fear of them.
